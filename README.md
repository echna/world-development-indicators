Explorative analysis of indicators of developemement. Builing of multi dimensional data visualisation and analysis tools in relation to the database of world developement indicators found at https://www.kaggle.com/worldbank/world-development-indicators/scripts. 

The World Development Indicators from the World Bank contain over a thousand annual indicators of economic development from hundreds of countries around the world. The dataset hosted here is a slightly transformed verion of the raw files (available at http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators) to facilitate analytics

Future avenues may explore relationships with world climate data found at https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data.
